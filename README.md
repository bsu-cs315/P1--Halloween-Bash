## Project Report
### Reflection:
**Iteration 1:**
The most challenging part of this first iteration was trying to play around in Godot Engine to figure out how to implement new features on my own. Some of these that gave me trouble at first were things like drawing a trajectory line and moving that line in a consistent arc versus by Vector points. The challenge of this kept me thinking constantly about how I could implement something I wanted to in the best way possible, and researching what Godot Engine was even capable of as well.

### Self-Evaluation:
- [x] D-1: The repository link is submitted to Canvas before the project deadline.

- [x] C-1: Your repository is well-formed, with an appropriate <code>.gitignore</code> file and no unnecessary files tracked.
- [x] C-2: The repository is tagged using <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> where the major version is zero, the minor version is the iteration number, and the patch version is incremented as normal for each change made to the minor version. The link submitted on Canvas is to the relevant release.
- [x] C-3: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, and the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the <code>README.md</code> file.
- [x] C-4: The project content is eligible for an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">ESRB Rating</a> of T or less.
- [x] C-5: The player can control the angle at which the projectile is fired.
- [x] C-6: The player can fire the projectile.
- [x] C-7: The projectile's flight is affected by gravity using Godot Engine's physics system.
- [x] C-8: There is a &ldquo;ground&rdquo; that stops the projectile.
- [x] C-9: There is a non-ground target that the projectile can hit.
- [x] B-1: The <code>README.md</code> file contains a personal reflection on the iteration as well as the reflections from previous iterations, if any.
- [x] B-2: The <code>README.md</code> file contains a self-assessment.
- [x] B-3: The release is published to GitHub Pages with a link provided in the <code>README.md</code> file.
- [x] B-4: The projectile's firing angle is clamped between 0&deg; (straight forward) and 90&deg; (straight up).
- [x] B-5: Once fired, the projectile is non-interactive.
- [x] A-1: The player can modify the strength of the projectile's firing.
- [x] A-2: There is a visual indicator showing the angle at which the projectile will fire.
- [x] A-3: The projectile's hitting the target is recognized and logged to the console or otherwise indicated.
