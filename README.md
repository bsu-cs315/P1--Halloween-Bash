## Project Report
### Reflection:
**Iteration 2:**
A huge challenge for this iteration was getting the player to respawn with the same properties after stopping. It was hard to get a new instance spawned in without getting null errors from some of the checks I was running for collisions or state changes. After spending a while stuck on the problem, I decided to focus on the other easier aspects and come back to the issue. It helped tremendously to get a new perspective and fresh look on the problem.
