## Project Report
### Reflection:
**Iteration 3:**
In iteration 3, the most challenging, but also most interesting and fun feature was switching between a title scene and the main level scene. I tried a couple different ways of going about the switching and ran into error after error before using the simple change_to method. Once I found the right method it was as easy as calling it in the correct place within the script and it was simple. I enjoyed learning about switching between scenes because it gives me many ideas about the possibilities of having multiple levels or stages and creating more of a fully fledged game at some point in time.
