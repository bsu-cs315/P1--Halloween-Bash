## Project Report
### Reflection:
**Iteration 1:**
The most challenging part of this first iteration was trying to play around in Godot Engine to figure out how to implement new features on my own. Some of these that gave me trouble at first were things like drawing a trajectory line and moving that line in a consistent arc versus by Vector points. The challenge of this kept me thinking constantly about how I could implement something I wanted to in the best way possible, and researching what Godot Engine was even capable of as well.
